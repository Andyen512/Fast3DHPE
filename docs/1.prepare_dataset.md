# Prepare dataset

## Datasets

Our model is evaluated on [Human3.6M](http://vision.imar.ro/human3.6m) and [MPI-INF-3DHP](https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/3dhp-dataset/) datasets. 

### Human3.6M

We set up the Human3.6M dataset in the same way as [VideoPose3D](https://github.com/facebookresearch/VideoPose3D/blob/master/DATASETS.md).  You can download the processed data from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FMgAf_I04GlweHMfgUKzB0CMwglxuwPe/view?usp=sharing).  `data_2d_h36m_gt.npz` is the ground truth of 2D keypoints. `data_2d_h36m_cpn_ft_h36m_dbb.npz` is the 2D keypoints obatined by [CPN](https://github.com/GengDavid/pytorch-cpn).  `data_3d_h36m.npz` is the ground truth of 3D human joints. Put them in the `./data` directory.

### MPI-INF-3DHP

We set up the MPI-INF-3DHP dataset following [D3DP](https://github.com/paTRICK-swk/D3DP). You can download the processed data from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zOM_CvLr4Ngv6Cupz1H-tt1A6bQPd_yg/view?usp=share_link). Put them in the `./data` directory.
